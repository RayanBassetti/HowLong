My first Google Chrome extension.
Quite a personnal topic, but hey, you're here to check out the code right ?

... right ?

# How it works : 

- Makes the default new tab changed with a pink background, and a Javascript timer set to a date.
- Adds the option to click on the extension icon, and develop the timer in a reducted way.
- Displays a random text from a local JSON collection.

# Languages used : 

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

# Plans : 

- Optimize the use of the JSON collection
- Switch everything to JQuery if possible
